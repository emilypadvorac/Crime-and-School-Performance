### This study is a course wide project in Applied Data Science class, Fall 2017, NYU CUSP

This research seeks to explore the relationship between school quality and crime in New
York City. The goal is to better understand if crimes near schools negatively impact school
performance or if low quality schools result in areas with higher levels of crime. To do this, data
will be used from 2007 and 2013, as well as the changes between those years, to additionally
assess how areas may have changed over time. Our hypothesis is that crime near schools
negatively impacts school performance, particularly when looking at certain categories of
crimes, such as drug-related offenses.
